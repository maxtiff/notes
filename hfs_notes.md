How do familial networks impact wealth. How do they influence debt assumption; or debt avoidance; or debt reduction; propensity to save; the need to save; the ability to absorb shock; liquidity; health. Ultimately, how do these networks influence progenial decision making and how does that impact wealth growth across racial and ethnic lines.

How can improved access to financial products improve wealth. What can enhance the outcomes of such access? Financial education? Better education in general? What community programs can help? 

Can technology reduce status quo bias and other barriers to balance sheet building. What sorts of systems would be most effective? What are the caveats of these systems?

Field test Kingdom House and St. Louis Community Credit Union and balance sheet health improvement. High interest rate Loan burden mitigation. [Carter, Skiba, Tobacman at Wharton; U of Wisc Field Testing Outcome Measures for Community-based Financial Coaching and Capability Programs.]

Is entry into traditional financial markets (mortage borrowing for many) for the historical underbanked more costly than it is for non-underbanked? [SPECULATION: What sortof spectre exists that prevents people from making informed decisions? Do they inherently trust or yield to the person with whom they are dealing?]

What hazards do formerly underbanked or unbanked clients face when entering a market in which there is extreme information asymmetry. What types of pecuniary mistakes do they make?

How does mortgage broker rent seeking behavior affect costs for new entrants into financial markets.[reword]

Why are there even wider gaps in financial health scores when looking at racial and ethnic groups that are middle-aged and well educated?

Other than age and education, what could possibly explain the differences in wealth accumulation across racial and ethnic lines?

Trade-off glut. Time poverty. Does this affect single female households more, single male households, dual households. How does parity allow for trade-off reduction.

How impactful are financial decisions/pecuniary mistakes during 'bulk' wealth building years? 

How are families affected if there are fewer people who exist during 'bulk wealth building years'?

'Missing males' -- Stephen Bronars' research.

Could expanding EITC reduce the phenomenoa of missing males in low income urban areas by incentivizing work via tax burden reduction? [Hoynes and Patel]

How does EITC expansion impact childhood health and cognitive function. How are these effects represented in balance sheet outcomes? [Arloc Sherman CBPP.org, http://www.cbpp.org/blog/brain-studies-highlight-importance-of-anti-poverty-policies-for-children]

Does this expansion promote wage growth? Would it reduce dependency on transfer payments?

In effect could this prevent 'Network destruction'.

Brain devotion and cognitive burden: living in poverty is stressful and time occupying, how does it affect ability to honor financial obligations? How can financial institutions engage or help customers?

The underbanked have high material costs: cashing checks and paying bills are expensive. What other material costs are associated with this population? I.e. do they lack access to multiple shopping options, what types of goods are most frequently available to them (alcohol) [Marianne Bertrand, Sendhil Mullainathan, Eldar Shafir]

Does access to faster modes of transportation improve balance sheets? Not strictly speaking as transportation as a financial asset, but is transportation a technology that allows for better control over time, thereby reducing tradeoffs or cognitive burden? Are there other exogenous factors in the livlihoods of the underbanked that impede access to the financial system?

Education is clearly the most important way for a group to get ahead. Why are states devoting fewer and fewer resources to education? How could improved education policy improve outcomes for different groups? How does increased financing towards justice systems affect education outcomes in states? What policy actions DECREASE educational outcomes? 

How does historical lack of economic opportunity prevent wealth gains presently?

Does this lack of opportunity force participation in black markets? How would elimination of those markets affect households?

How do certain events or policies affect asset building across discrete racial and ethnic groups?

How do financial shocks reverberate in households that have poor balance sheet health/little liquidity. Are there amplification effects? How can a household mitigate these effects?

Is the cost of borrowing higher for different racial and ethnic groups? Are undereducated groups likely to make pecuniary mistakes when borrowing for education? 

What accounts for the growing discrepancies in financial health as groups get older.

Location and longterm financial well-being. Rural vs Urban.

Status quo bias amongst people with poor balance sheet health.

Technology and new access to financial markets. What are poor countries doing? How do financial companies mitigate risk and cost associated with acquiring new customers. Once acquired, how does financial health improve. Compare to populations in the United States.
